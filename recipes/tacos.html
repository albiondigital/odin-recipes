        make these tacos de birria:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is
            cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
        <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
        <li>Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart,
            basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.</li>
