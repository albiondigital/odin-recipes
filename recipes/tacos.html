    <p>Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a
        delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this
        impressive meal. This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Dried chile peppers: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers,
            and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
        <li>Beef: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly
            easily.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and
            oregano.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Vinegar: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
        <li>Tortillas: Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
        <li>Onion and cilantro: Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and
            texture.</li>
    </ol>
